# Asp.Net-ReactNativeTodoList

## I know it's a todo list...
I'm sure you saw a whole lot of todo lists and that this is nothing special but I was trying to learn as much as possible during creation of this app. This is my first time doing some fullstack app on my own and my first time with React Native.

## Features
### 1.
User authentication and authorization created with Asp .Net Core Identity, based on JWT token with usage of refresh token to ensure better safety and user's experience
### 2.
Every information is saved in database created by Entity Framework in Code First approach (but I know some SQL too)
### 3. 
I wanted my backend to use repository design pattern (and I hope it's not that bad)
### 4. 
I'm not a UI designer but I did my best. This was my first time using React Native (or React at all) and I've tried to keep it nice and clean
